#| approach
skip front matter, which can differ like:
The Son of Nephi, who was the Son of Helaman",
or
3,74,1279,33405,Book of Mormon,Mosiah,The Book of Mormon,The Book of Mosiah,Another Testament of Jesus Christ,""

but instead start at the
"BoM"

BoM,Ether,bm,ether,4,2,And after Christ truly had showed himself unto his people he commanded that they should be made manifest.,Ether 4:2,Ether 4:2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7th element is the text, 7th is the book and verse, 8th is also book and verse?
BoM,3 Ne.,bm,3-ne,6,11,"For there were many merchants in the land, and also many lawyers, and many officers.",3 Nephi 6:11,3 Ne. 6:11
1 2 3 4 5 6 7th is the text ...in quotes!? 8th is book and verse, 9th is book and verse but with book abreviated.
